# AI-Powered Gardening Hub
### Integrating Generative & Agentic AI for Sustainable Gardening  
**Author:** Mya Stenson
## Check out the prototype here: https://green-thumb-ai.figma.site/



## 🌱 Overview
The **AI-Powered Gardening Hub** is a web-based system that analyzes real-time environmental data—soil moisture, sunlight, temperature, air quality, and more—to help users care for their gardens with confidence. Using generative AI, IoT sensors, and sustainable design principles, the hub provides personalized guidance for planting, watering, fertilizing, layout planning, and ongoing maintenance.

This project began as a small idea about simplifying gardening but has evolved into a full design concept blending data-driven logic, human-centered design, and sustainability-focused innovation.



## 🎯 Project Goals
- Support home and community gardeners in making informed decisions  
- Interpret environmental data through AI analysis for tailored guidance  
- Balance user control with AI autonomy (Assistive Mode vs. Agentic Mode)  
- Promote sustainable and accessible food production  


## ✨ Key Features

### Real-Time Environmental Monitoring
- Soil moisture, density, nutrient levels  
- Weather and sunlight data  
- Air quality and humidity  
- Seasonal and climate-based insights  

### AI-Generated Guidance
- Planting tips and timing  
- Watering and nutrient schedules  
- Adaptive care plans driven by forecasts  
- Visual garden layout suggestions  

### Sensor & Hardware Integration
- IoT soil probes  
- Weather APIs  
- Optional solar hardware  
- Smart shade systems  
- Raspberry Pi / Arduino compatibility  

### User Interface & Experience
- Clean, organic color palette  
- Simple dashboard visualizing trends  
- Conversational AI assistant  
- Optional community-sharing tab  



## 🧠 Ethical & Creative Framework
This project follows two main principles:

1. **AI should assist, not replace, human decision-making.**  
2. **Technology should help preserve and uplift environmental knowledge.**

The system emphasizes transparency, autonomy, accessibility, and responsible environmental design.



## 🛠 System Architecture

### Frontend
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

### Backend (Planned)
- Local server prototype  
- Weather + sensor data integration  
- API architecture for AI responses  

### AI Components
- Generative model for guidance  
- Agentic logic for automated actions  
- Real-time analysis loop  



## 🔁 Interaction Flow
1. User inputs garden details  
2. Sensors send live data  
3. AI generates insights and recommendations  
4. User chooses between:  
   - **Assistive Mode** (approve each action)  
   - **Agentic Mode** (system acts within safe limits)  
5. Every system action is logged for transparency  



## 👥 Target Users
- Home gardeners  
- Urban farmers  
- Educators and classrooms  
- Environmental sustainability advocates
